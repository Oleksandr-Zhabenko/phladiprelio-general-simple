The library is the new implementation of the ideas related to PhLADiPreLiO (Phonetic Languages
Approach to Discovering the Preferred Line Options) for different languages. It uses hashes and
has at the moment (as of the version 0.20.0.0) not the full functionality. The previous implementation 
and its documentation are at the links:

The examples of the using the new functionality in the 0.8.0.0 version is in two short videos by
the links below (they are for the phladiprelio-ukrainian-simple, the parallel project for Ukranian):

[+f <filename> <code> mode additions](https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/videos/593118766229253/)

[+m <another filename> <another code> mode — new one in this version](https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/videos/325188039864718/)

Since the version 0.6.0.0 the default mode for non-tests output is in two-column. This improves 
the UI / UX for the end user. Besides there is the possibility to write the result to a file.

The video with the demonstration of the new functionality in the version 0.6.0.0 is by the link for
the parallel project phladiprelio-ukrainian-simple:

[demo for version 0.6.0.0](https://www.facebook.com/100012184148486/posts/1767318773684244)

Examples of the new functionality in the version 0.5.1.1 of the related prototype project for 
Ukrainian is in the videos:

See the demonstration video for the new functionality in version 0.11.0.0 by the link on the example
of the parallel project usage:
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zapAPpQ-fc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zapAPpQ-fc4)

Since the version 0.12.0.0 there is a possibility to compare the distances (opposite to the
similarity measure) for the line options using the +l2 ... -l2 command line group of options. It is
generally a completely new functionality for the package.

Since the version 0.13.0.0 there is a possibility to change the durations of the selected syllables
using the ={set of digits} precisely after the needed syllable. For more information, see the output
of the call of the program with the -h command line argument. This significantly extends the general
possibilities of the program, especially for the music composing.

Since the version 0.13.0.0 there is a possibility to change the durations of the selected syllables
using the ={set of digits} precisely after the needed syllable. For more information, see the output
of the call of the program phladiprelioUkr from the parallel project phladiprelio-ukrainian-simple 
with the -h command line argument. This significantly extends the general
possibilities of the program, especially for the music composing.

Since the version 0.14.0.0 there were fixed issues with distance between line options in several branches and added a possibility to analyse and compare two lines from the same file using either additionally to +m also +m2 group of command line arguments, or +m3 group of arguments instead.

For the list of bash aliases a few of which are used in the videos, see:
https://github.com/Oleksandr-Zhabenko/phladiprelio-alias/blob/main/.bashrc

The version 0.14.2.0 fixes issue with one syllable before '=' sign in the music mode and applies some performance improvements.

 Breaking changes in version 0.20.0.0
 ====================================

Since the version 0.20.0.0 the way of calculation is significantly changed, therefore the results are expected to be different. Please, have this in mind. It is expected to have larger groups and more options to choose from. Nevertheless, the approach becomes more stable. The performance and resources consumtion are very closely comparable with probably some subtle differences between versions 0.15.* and 0.20.0.0.
